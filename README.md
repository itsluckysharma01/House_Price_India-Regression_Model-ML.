# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Regression)

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for building a regression model to predict house prices based on various features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House_Price_Prediction-Regresssion.git
   cd House_Price_Prediction-Regresssion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Interactive Demo

## ⚙️ Usage

- **Train the model:**  
  Edit `main.py` or use the provided notebook to train with your data.
- **Predict prices:**  
  Use the trained model to predict house prices for new samples.

## 📝 Example

```python
from model import predict_price

features = {
    "sqft": 2000,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    # ...other features...
}
price = predict_price(features)
print(f"Predicted price: ${price:,.2f}")
```
